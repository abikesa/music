    "Ranking Mozart's operas by the distinctness and depth of character arcs would certainly highlight his genius in crafting multidimensional personalities. Here’s how I would rank them, focusing on the range of characters who are more than mere foils to the protagonist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Don Giovanni\"** – This one tops the list. Every character has a unique moral compass, and their interactions are complex, chaotic, and deeply human. Giovanni’s arrogance and hedonism contrast sharply with the serious and vengeful Donna Anna, the naive Zerlina, and the conflicted Leporello, each with their own vivid arc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"Le Nozze di Figaro\" (The Marriage of Figaro)** – While Figaro and Susanna are central, the secondary characters—especially Count Almaviva and Cherubino—have richly developed trajectories. There’s a balance between comedy and drama, with everyone entangled in a plot that critiques class structures while showing their personal growth or folly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"Così fan tutte\"** – The emotional and moral development here is fascinating because of the experiment that tests the fidelity of lovers. The characters—Fiordiligi, Dorabella, Guglielmo, and Ferrando—undergo dramatic transformations as they grapple with betrayal, desire, and moral ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **\"Die Zauberflöte\" (The Magic Flute)** – Though its fantastical setting might suggest simplicity, this opera is filled with characters on distinct journeys. Tamino’s quest for enlightenment is intertwined with Papageno’s simpler desires, and both Sarastro and the Queen of the Night present extreme ideological opposites. It’s a microcosm of human experience within allegory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **\"Idomeneo\"** – Here we see significant arcs, particularly with Ilia, Idamante, and Idomeneo himself. The psychological and emotional turmoil that drives the characters forward—especially Idomeneo's inner conflict about sacrificing his son—adds depth to what could otherwise be a conventional mythological tale.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **\"La Clemenza di Tito\"** – Although it’s one of Mozart’s later works, the characters undergo a moral evolution that’s intricate and sincere. The conflict between Vitellia’s ambition and Sesto’s loyalty to Tito, alongside Tito’s magnanimous clemency, creates a web of personal and political intrigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **\"Lucio Silla\"** – The characters in this early work are not as fully fleshed out as in his later operas, but there’s a clear attempt to give Lucio, Giunia, and Cecilio meaningful arcs. It’s less chaotic and more rigid in its development, yet it foreshadows the depth Mozart would later achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, **Don Giovanni** stands as Mozart’s most profound exploration of multiple character arcs. Each individual is part of a greater chaotic dance, embodying the unpredictability of life and death, morality, and impulsive desire. The more distinct and dynamic these arcs, the more they serve as metaphors for human complexity."
