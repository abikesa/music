  1. Construct
  2. Metaphypsics
     - History shows us that ambiguity of the higher overtones is what permits equal temperement
  3. Physics
  4. Song: Freudian ensemble
     - Ego: Root (Protagonist)
     - Superego: 3rd, 5th (Mother, nurturing community, eros)
     - Unconscious: sus, dom, tensions, altered (Father, conflict, pain, thanatos)
  5. Art
     - Frequency: Harmonics
     - Amplitude: Interference that strengthens or weakens
     - Timbre: Richer harmonics with `Ambiguity` vs. Synthetic with `Precision`
  6. Life

- [Basic Instinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Instinct) as neo-noir erotic thriller
- Suspense chords enhance ambiguity about `Whodunnit`
- Blonde lesbian couple who look very much alike are suspected in turn
- Then it turns out that a brunnet who is a former classmate of one of the blondes might be the one
- Well, both are psychologists who are well-versed in manipulation afterall (one as a shrink and other as a neo-noir erotic thriller novelist)
- Added ambiguity is the movie we are watching vs. the novel in the movie and if they are related or predictive of each other
- To conclude, harmonics in the triad are unambiguous. But as one goes higher up with stacks of minor triads (e.g. half-dimished), ambiguity increases
