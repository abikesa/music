- [Basic Instinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Instinct) as neo-noir erotic thriller
- Suspense chords enhance ambiguity about `Whodunnit`
- Blonde lesbian couple who look very much alike are suspected in turn
- Then it turns out that a brunnet who is a former classmate of one of the blondes might be the one
- Well, both are psychologists who are well-versed in manipulation afterall (one as a shrink and other as a neo-noir erotic thriller novelist)
- Added ambiguity is the movie we are watching vs. the novel in the movie and if they are related or predictive of each other
- To conclude, harmonics in the triad are unambiguous. But as one goes higher up with stacks of minor triads (e.g. half-dimished), ambiguity increases
