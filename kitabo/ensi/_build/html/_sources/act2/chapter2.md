# Chapter 2
This is a fascinating task, requiring an understanding of how different groups—performers, audiences, and composers themselves—evaluate and rank classical music composers. Each of these perspectives highlights different priorities: performers value the technical demands and expressive potential of the music, audiences respond to emotional impact and accessibility, and composers admire innovation, structure, and technique.

Here are three ranked lists for each group (Performers, Audience, and Composers), with brief justifications.
