In the Western classical music tradition, Richard Wagner is often credited with pushing tonal music to its limits. Wagner, a 19th-century German composer, is known for his innovative use of harmony, orchestration, and form. His operas, such as "Tristan und Isolde" and "The Ring Cycle," contain chromaticism, unresolved dissonances, and extended tonal structures that challenged the conventions of the time. Wagner's work is considered a significant step towards the dissolution of tonality and the emergence of the more atonal and chromatic music of the 20th century.

The influence of Richard Wagner can be seen in the work of several composers who came after him, often referred to as his heirs. Some notable composers influenced by Wagner include:

1. **Richard Strauss:** A German composer, Strauss was heavily influenced by Wagner's orchestrations and dramatic use of the orchestra. His tone poems, such as "Also sprach Zarathustra" and "Ein Heldenleben," exhibit Wagnerian influences.

2. **Gustav Mahler:** An Austrian composer and conductor, Mahler was deeply influenced by Wagner's use of the orchestra and the integration of vocal and symphonic elements. His symphonies, especially the later ones, show Wagnerian traits.

3. **Claude Debussy:** A French composer, Debussy admired Wagner's innovative harmonic language. While he later distanced himself from Wagner's influence, traces of Wagnerian chromaticism can be found in some of Debussy's early works.

4. **Arnold Schoenberg:** An Austrian composer, Schoenberg initially admired Wagner but later developed his own atonal and twelve-tone techniques. Nevertheless, Wagner's impact on Schoenberg's early works is evident.

It's important to note that while these composers were influenced by Wagner, they also developed their unique styles and contributed to diverse musical movements, including late-Romanticism, impressionism, and the move towards atonality in the 20th century.
