   - Well, Cole Porter tells us that even [birds do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXYKGL6MgKM): they sing when they fall in love
   - And we can correlate their melodies with our human musical constructs
   - [Voir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&si=s8CAU0CP55LXSMHJ&v=QdcmuYpkkNA&feature=youtu.be): But how far up the harmomic series can the human ear go?
      - Here's my litmus-test for depth and breadth of understanding, aesthetics, and sensory acquity
      - Candace might be a defender of "traditional" values that distinguish between `expression` of the masculine and feminine
      - I guess my question is that can she handle the biological fact of Semenya who defies the dichotomies that spring from Judeo-Christian values?
      - Remember that while dreams are common to the Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian views they yield moralities that are beyond good & evil (Greco-Roman) and entirely about heaven & hell (Judeo-Christian) 
2. Pentatonic
   - Hades to the Greek is conceptualized as beyond good and evil since everyone ends up there; The christians create a dichotomy for the afterlife
   - And so when we visit the upper reaches of the harmonic series (e.g. Semenya's testosterone levels) the Judeo-Christian view remains deaf and insists on the lower harmonics as "normal", indeed foundational of "good" and exemplary. In my view this is merely an issue of [sensory acquity](https://muzaale.github.io/thesis/act_0/act_0_0/act_0_0_0/act_0_0_0_2.html) and early-stage frailty!
   - The `lower harmonics` 1st (foundational), 3rd (perfect fifth), 5th (major third), 7th (minor seventh), 9th (first extended chord) are the most audible
   - Its from whence all ancient cultures across the world derive the pentatonic scale 
   - Empirically supported (equal temperement)
      - The best argument against purists. Here a midway compromise between "the truth" and "more freedom" to compose, orchestrate, modulate, and progress 
4. Diatonic
   - But only a more sophisticated ear will pick the `mid-range harmonics` including the #11 and 13th
   - Harmony & dissonance are proof of authenticity (wave theory): frequency, amplitude, interference, `harmonics`, timbre
      - Of course harmonics are higher frequency tones that occur naturally alongside the fundamental tone when a note is played. They add richness, warmth, and complexity to the sound (wave theory)
5. Chromatic
   - Only the most nuanced will go so far as to hear the `upper harmonics` including the 17th & 19th
   - It's noteworthy that the 19th harmonic marks the emergence of the minor-third triad with relation to the fundamental (i.e., the 16th harmonic)
   - And the 17th gives us the wormhole called a [Neapolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_chord#:~:text=In%20Classical%20music%20theory%2C%20a,of%20the%20corresponding%20Phrygian%20mode.) which segues the ear to another mode in a i-IV-V progression. The IV feels a bit "different", and as the first inversion of this chord (which could be serve as the root a Phrygian II root. Just listen to Lacrimosa!
6. Temperament
   - Few human ears will be able to distinguish intervals beyond the 19th harmonic
   - Its perhaps in the 16th century late in the renaissance that Italians recognized this
   - And so they encoded all this in "scales", codified it in the piano "keys", and decoded a natural constraint
   - Breaking free of this constraint to allow ensembles to perform and to also freely express them selves by modulation, a program culminating in equal temperament was began
7. Expression
   - African music has been stuck at pentatonic but compensated by developing very advanced pockets, rhythms, and grooves within which sound and dance might be channeled
      - Ancient
         - Greek
         - Byzantine
         - Rome
         - Christendom
         - Art
      - Rennaissance
         - Baroque
         - Classic
         - Romanticism

         - I´m a prof. pianist and I know quite a few colleagues. And everyone of them was about to give up his profession after listening to Oscar Peterson in concert. 
It´s not only his virtuosity or his `anatomy` (left hand span) that´s unbelievable, it´s his lightning-fast planning what to play next what´s even more jaw dropping. And that means that his `mental` precondition might have been even more exceptional than his sheer technical abilities.
         - Of course the above statement misses something key: I briefly met Oscar Peterson inside the Royal York Hotel. Warm and friendly he said 'Hello'. He recorded songs that are more gospel than jazz with the most beautiful chord arrangements I have ever heard.
         - Gospel teaches one how to `listen`, first by laying out the mental approach that gospel pros have used. Its the same that Bach used or any great improviser. Y'all professors can't get it since its like you learned how to read english before you could speak it
