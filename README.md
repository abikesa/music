1. Construct
   - Grounded in metaphysics (harmonic series)
2. Metaphysics
   - Empirically supported (equal temperement)
      - The best argument against purists. Here a midway compromise between "the truth" and "more freedom" to compose, orchestrate, modulate, and progress 
3. Physics
   - Harmony & dissonance are proof of authenticity (wave theory): frequency, amplitude, interference, `harmonics`, timbre
      - Of course harmonics are higher frequency tones that occur naturally alongside the fundamental tone when a note is played. They add richness, warmth, and complexity to the sound (wave theory)
4. Song
   - Relation on harmony to the solo protagonist who is narrator or in dialogue between metaphysics vs. physics (narrative journey)
5. Art
   - Indifferent/Passive: 7th; earlier, harmonics 
      - [Amerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Thing#Theme_and_sound): She told Blender that the "one thing" "could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this [good girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSXqpzdn2QQ), but there are other sides they don't see." (chord progression)
   - Enabling/Verb: Others, Blues, Dorminants; furthest harmonics
   - [Antagonistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeoBFbcA-aM)/Proactive: 6th; limits craving resolution 
6. Life
   - Eternally recurrent tragic [quantized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0FxVGan0_8) cadence of the same (grooves, pockets)
      - Ancient
         - Greek
