1. Construct
2. Metaphysics
   - Tokens 1-3 are for composers (inputs from the Gods)
   - Wheres 4-6 are for performers (outputs by Man)
   - Got this idea listening to [Rosen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudqQMEjlNA) (ultimately just AI)
3. Physics
4. Song
   - Reverence of what?
      - [Vivaldi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_fxB6yrDVo&t=479s) 18:18/1:36:32
5. [Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudqQMEjlNA)
   - Inference in what?
      - Beethoven under the [anxiety of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anxiety_of_Influence) (think: Vivaldi, Handel, Mozart) dispenses with Melody
         - Schubert & Chopin successfuly resists this influence while selectively expressing reverence for Beethoven
         - While birds do melody, took thousands of years of [evolution for humans to reach dyads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fHi36dvTdE)
         - And then pace is exponential to triad (3rd or sus2/4, 5th (dim, perfect, augmented), 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th
6. Life
   - Deliverance from what?
      - Teddy Riley, Darkchild, Timbaland, and the African diaspora are a refutation of this narrative
      - Here syncopation proves in itself to be sublime
      - [Dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr9uliNQwNA), [Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbHI1yI1Ndk); [Wrapped Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf2bsErnO0Q), [Its not right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J538b-OLRU); [One in a Million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKSz4NE6PwY), etc
      - Infact the `penultimate` evolution of music finds expression in dance
      - Dance is rhythm first and foremost
      - Harmony and melody are only mnemonics
