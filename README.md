4. Song
   - Relation on harmony to the solo protagonist who is narrator or in dialogue between metaphysics vs. physics (narrative journey)
5. Art
   - Indifferent/Passive: 7th (Earliest harmonics)

People think I'm just this [good girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSXqpzdn2QQ), but there are other sides they don't see." (chord progression)
   - Enabling/Verb: Others, Blues, Domants (Furthest harmonics)
   - [Antagonistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeoBFbcA-aM)/Proactive: 6th (Limits craving resolution)
