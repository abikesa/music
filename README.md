   - Antiquarian/Reverence/`Melody`
     - Beethoven under the [anxiety of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anxiety_of_Influence) (think: Vivaldi, Handel, Mozart) dispenses with Melody
     - Schubert & Chopin successfuly resists this influence while selectively expressing reverence for Beethoven
   - Monumental/Inference/`Chords`
     - Evolution of genres viewed under evolution of harmony
     - Birds do melody, but takes thousands of years of [evolution for humans to reach dyads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fHi36dvTdE)
     - And then pace is exponential to triad, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th
   - `Critical`/Deliverence/`Rhythm`
     - Teddy Riley, Darkchild, Timbaland, and the African diaspora are a refutation of this narrative
     - Here syncopation proves in itself to be sublime

[Tiny Desk Concerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tiny_Desk_Concerts) has previously drawn `criticism` for narrowness in the musical `genres` it includes-— described as focused on "hipster-infused indie rock" by Zachary Crockett at Vox -—to the exclusion of genres like country and hip-hop. However, the series' musical focus has broadened in scope over `time`
