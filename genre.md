    - [Jon B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xt7qRfDdzU), Brian McKnight
      - Both from musical families
      - And both had classically trained mothers
      - Who were also music teachers
      - Yet they chose self-instruction
      - It was only way to capture the `soul` of what they liked
      - Jimmy Jam & Lewis, Babyface
      - Teaching wouldn't reach there
      - Of course its interesting enough that Jon B was in high school gospel choir
