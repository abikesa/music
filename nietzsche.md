# Gospel music and the birth of duality (i.e., psychology)

1. [Birth of tragedy](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Attempt_at_Self-Criticism)::`Visions`
2. Scholarship as a problem::`Illusions`
   - When Metaphysics and Physics clash
       - Music, like math, deals in abstractions that are tethered to reality.
       - The empiricism of science, accounting, business, bets, taxes, and governance lends legitimacy to math
           - A metaphysics attempts to explain everything and $R^2$ states how well it does
           - Experimental methods create highly controlled systems within which a decent $R^2$ might be realized
           - From this perspective all science and scholarship consists of idealizing instead of confronting reality head on, which is what business does
       - Similarly, the emotions lifeâ€™s challenges and victories evoke are mirrored by music, making it the most relatable item in human history
   - A resonant world view vs. dissonant experiences
   - Tension & release are born
   - You'll find that received wisdom [agrees and disagrees](https://github.com/abikesa/journal/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) with a lived experience
3. Empiricism vs. Romanticism::`Frailty`  
   - Uneven in tempo
   - Extremely self-confident
   - Dispensing of evidence
4. Chorus vs Logic
   - Regardless, music is very firmly tethered to reality and would help distinguish the Greeks from pious Christians:
      - Skill, $x$
      - Challenge, $y$
      - Emotion, $(x, y)$
      - Tool, $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$
      - Agency, $x=y$
      - Flow $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}=1$
5. Morality vs. Aesthetics
   - Unthinking and amoral artist-God
6. Optimism vs. Pessimism
   - Here is announced, perhaps for the first time, a pessimism "beyond good and evil." Here comes that "perversity in belief" in word and formula, a philosophy which dared to place morality itself in the world of phenomena and so to subsume it, not under the "visions" (in the sense of some idealistic end point) but under "illusions," as an appearance, delusion, fallacy, interpretation, something made up, a work of art.
