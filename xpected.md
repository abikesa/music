# Casablanca

- WWII disrupted all sorts of social orders and hierarchies and wity dialogue captures this:
   - Scene is set where its clear "only money" is allowed; no one has credit!
   - "Your money will be good at the bar," Rick says to a Deutche banker brandishing a credit note 
   - "Perhaps if you told him I was running the second leading banking house in Amsterdam," a patron says in response to suggestion that Rick is too snobbish to mingle with customers
   - "That wouldn't impress him. The leading banker in Amsterdam in now the best chef in our kitchen... And his father is the Bell Boy," utters a French Professor waiting on them.
