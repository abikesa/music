# Casablanca

- WWII disrupted all sorts of social orders and hierarchies and wity dialogue captures this:
   - Scene is set where its clear "only money" is allowed; no one has credit!
   - "Your money will be good at the bar," Rick says to a Deutche banker brandishing a credit note 
   - "Perhaps if you told him I was running the second leading banking house in Amsterdam," a patron says in response to suggestion that Rick is too snobbish to mingle with customers
   - "That wouldn't impress him. The leading banker in Amsterdam in now the best chef in our kitchen... And his father is the Bell Boy," utters a French Professor waiting on them.
   - Rick is cynical, no one can please him, but at the end of a conversation filled with subtlety, he reveals he is impressed with the shady gentleman who perhaps killed the `two German couriers carrying letters of transit`
   - Of course we know he at least has a political stance in this war even though he acts `indifferent`, hideth in Rick's cafe, in Casablanca -- this is a New Yorker afterall
   - But there's a backstory to this of course and Freudian ensemble might help with that

Your reflection weaves together a fascinating tapestry that integrates musical constructs with the metaphysics of existence, the physical basis of sound, and the narrative depth of song and art, all culminating in the broader context of life's experiences. This multidimensional framework offers a rich lens through which to analyze and appreciate the complexity of both music and life. Let's delve into how each component—Construct, Metaphysics, Physics, Song, Art, and Life—interplays within this schema, particularly through the prism of the iconic film "Casablanca," which serves as a poignant illustration of these concepts in action.

### 1. **Construct: Harmonic Series**
The harmonic series forms the foundational construct of music, where a fundamental frequency and its harmonics create a complex and rich timbre. In "Casablanca," this can be seen in the layered characters and the intricate plot lines that, together, create a resonant story. Each character contributes a unique 'frequency' to the narrative, enriching the overall texture of the film.

### 2. **Metaphysics: Equal Temperament**
The concept of equal temperament in music—allowing composers to modulate to any key and maintain harmonic consonance—parallels the philosophical balance found in "Casablanca." The characters navigate a world upended by war, making compromises and finding balance in a reality where idealism often clashes with practicality. Rick's cafe, as a neutral ground amidst the chaos, symbolizes this balance.

### 3. **Physics: Wave Theory**
The physics of sound, through wave theory, elucidates how different frequencies, amplitudes, and timbres interact to create the phenomena of music. In "Casablanca," the "interference pattern" could metaphorically represent the complex relationships and conflicts between characters, their motives and actions creating a hierarchy of tensions that resonate throughout the story.

### 4. **Song: Freudian Ensemble (Ego, Superego, Id)**
Using Freudian psychoanalysis to interpret the characters in "Casablanca" provides a deep understanding of their motivations. Rick, as the Ego, navigates between his Id—represented by his desire to remain neutral and uninvolved—and his Superego, which emerges in his ultimately altruistic actions. This internal conflict, mirrored in the dialogues and interactions, plays a central melody in the narrative.

### 5. **Art: Triads, Extended, Altered**
Just as chords in music progress from simple triads to more complex extended and altered forms to express nuanced emotions, "Casablanca" uses complex character development and plot twists to deepen the emotional landscape. The characters' growth and changes reflect this progression from simple to complex, mirroring life's unpredictable journey.

### 6. **Life: Hideth, Whineth, Tameth**
The thematic elements of hiding, victory, and confronting one's destiny (Ragnarok) in "Casablanca" reflect the rhythm of life itself. Characters hide their true selves or intentions (Hideth), find personal victories in love and sacrifice (Whineth), and ultimately face their destinies head-on (Tameth), mirroring the `existential beats of the human experience`.

"Casablanca," with its rich narrative and complex characters set against the backdrop of WWII, encapsulates the interplay of these six concepts. The movie's ability to capture the essence of human experience through a musical lens—balancing the theoretical with the emotional, the individual with the collective, and the static with the dynamic—demonstrates the profound connection between music, life, and art. This multidisciplinary approach not only enriches our understanding of "Casablanca" but also offers a deeper appreciation of the intricate symphony of human existence.
