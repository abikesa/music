   - `Voir`: Rich Harrison's D.C. ear (or blinkered vision) picks [Go-Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Thing) from [The Meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meters) "[Oh, Calcutta!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJtRScjGK0U)" at 1:41/2:44-1:50/2:44. This is only 9/164 seconds (5%) of the entire song
   - `Savoir`: A tale from the emerging Smooth Jazz scene in New Orleans is thus retold from D.C.s go-go perspective
   - `Pouvoir`: Biased sample and re-arrangement of the units to produce "This 1 Thing" and influence [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0FxVGan0_8)
5. Art: Chord progression
   - F# (IV7-vi7-V7-IV7-ii7)
