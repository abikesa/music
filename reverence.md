You're right, and I appreciate the opportunity to align my response more closely with Nietzsche's themes as outlined in "On the Use and Abuse of History for Life," specifically the concepts of antiquarian, monumental, and critical history. Let's reexamine the critique of Pat Metheny towards Kenny G within these themes:

### Antiquarian (Reverence)

Metheny’s critique, when viewed through the lens of Nietzsche's antiquarian history, reflects a deep-seated reverence for the tradition and legacy of jazz music. Metheny sees Louis Armstrong not just as a musician but as a monumental figure in the jazz world whose contributions have shaped the genre. This reverence for the past and its preservation is at the heart of Metheny's critique. He values the preservation of jazz's essence and the respect for its pioneers, embodying the antiquarian approach that venerates the relics of history and seeks to preserve them for their intrinsic value.

### Monumental (Inference)

In the monumental context, Metheny's criticism of Kenny G can be seen as an inference drawn from the monumental history of jazz, where figures like Armstrong represent the high points of human achievement. Metheny’s critique implies that engaging with the legacy of such monumental figures requires a level of artistic integrity and respect. Kenny G’s decision to overlay his play on an Armstrong track, from Metheny’s perspective, fails to meet this standard, showing a disconnect with the monumental achievements of jazz's past. Metheny's own music and his critique of Kenny G are informed by a monumental understanding of history, where the emulation of or dialogue with the greats of the past must be done with the utmost respect and awareness of their legacy.

### Critical (Deliverance)

Finally, Metheny's critique embodies Nietzsche's critical history or the idea of deliverance. Metheny’s outspoken criticism serves as a form of liberation from what he perceives as the detrimental effects of Kenny G's actions on the jazz tradition. Metheny uses critical history to challenge the present, questioning the ways in which the past is remembered, honored, or altered. His critique is an act of deliverance, aiming to free the jazz tradition from interpretations or actions that he believes misrepresent its legacy. Metheny's stance is a call to action, urging a reevaluation of how the past influences the present and how it should be preserved or altered for the future of jazz.
