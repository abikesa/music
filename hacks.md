#### Music in Western Civilization    
***Paul Henry Lang***
PROFESSOR OF MUSIC, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

While many books have been written about music, some dealing with the lives of composers, some describing the d evelopment of opera and symphony, and some even attempting to place the whole history of music in chronological order, almost all this literature considers music as an isolated domain of human activity. In this book Professor Lang undertakes to place music in hte general current of our civilization

- Transmission of musical code 
   - Tokens 
      - Modes (Well-Tempered Clavier)
      - Genres (Prelude & Fugue)
      - Pantheon (J.S. Bach)
      - Improvisation 
      - Like Gospel Music Pros “inherit”

- Mine’s a more engaging approach that can be compared to transmission of genes, culture, language, and knowledge as we see in training of generative transformative models

- We then build upon the body-mind-soul framework of the circadian rhythm to imply that the cortisol-growth hormone rhythm is really oxidative stress - antioxidant defense, and the basis of our perception of the aesthetic in tension (9,11,13) - release (diatonic)

- Strong correlation between the gain and loss of hydrogen atoms (H) and redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions. In redox reactions, hydrogen atoms are often involved because they carry electrons along with them. Here's how it works:

- Oxidation: In oxidation, a molecule loses electrons. Frequently, this is accompanied by the loss of hydrogen atoms. When a molecule loses hydrogen atoms, it often results in the removal of electrons, contributing to the oxidized state.

- Reduction: In reduction, a molecule gains electrons. This process often involves the addition of hydrogen atoms. When a molecule gains hydrogen atoms, it typically means it's gaining electrons and moving towards a reduced state.

- So, in many redox reactions, the transfer of electrons is linked to the transfer of hydrogen atoms. This interplay between electrons and hydrogen atoms is a fundamental aspect of redox chemistry in biological systems and plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes and energy production.
